		<h2>About</h2>
		<p>
			Joanna "JoJo" Levesque is and American R&B and Pop singer, songwriter, and actress. Born on
			December 20, 1990 and raised in Foxborough, Massachusetts. JoJo started singing when she was
			about two years-old imitating nursery rhymes, R&B, jazz, and soul genres. Her mother and
			father were singers as well, but divorced when JoJo was four years-old. JoJo performed all the
			time in singing competitions, and local talent shows when she was very young. At seven
			years-old, she appeared on the shows Kids Say the Darndest Things: On the Road in Boston and
			Destination Stardom. In 2003, she was 12 when she signed with Blackground Records and Da
			Family and debuted her hit single, "Leave (Get Out)" which was released in 2004. It became
			number one on the Mainstream Top 40 chart, she was 13 when this happened and she was the
			youngest solo artist to have a number one single in the United States. She is also known for
			her songs, "Baby It's You" and "Not That Kind of Girl" from her first self titled album, JoJo.

			In 2006, JoJo started acting and appeared in the movie, Aquamarine, as Hailey. She also
			starred in RV, a comedy family movie with Robin Williams. In October 2006, JoJo's second
			album, The High Road, was released. Her single, "Too Little Too Late" became very popular as
			it was number three on the Billboard Hot 100. JoJo wanted to write her own songs for her third
			album and so it was in the works. Unfortunately, her songs were leaked through a YouTube
			channel. In 2009, JoJo was having trouble with her record label Da Family Entertainment for
			putting her in musical limbo and sought $500,000 for her troubles and was released from her
			contract. Blackground Records made a deal to have JoJo's thrid album distributed by Interscope

			continued acting and appeared on the TV show, Hawaii Five-0 as Courtney Russell. Her third
			album was still in the works and it was going to be called "All I want is Everything" but
			later changed it to "Jumping Trains", she wanted her music to be different and fresh. Her lead
			single, "The Other Chick" was supposed to be released digitally but the label made it a buzz
			single which was meant as a potential promotional song. JoJo remixed a song by rapper, Drake,
			called "Marvin's Room". She renamed it as "Marvin's Room (Can't Do Better)" and she wrote it
			as a female's perspective to express frustration towards an ex-lover and his supposed new
			girlfriend. Drake expressed his appreciation for her interpretation of his song.

			Family. She had filed a lawsuit against them for "irreparable damages to her professional
			career". The case was dropped in December 2013 as JoJo and Blackground's attourneys came to an
			agreement outside the court. In January 2014, she was released from her multi-year battle with
			Blackground Records and signed a new recording contract with Atlantic Records. She released an
			extended play, "#LoveJo", on February 14, 2014, that covers three classic songs "Caught Up in
			the Rapture of Love", "Take Me Home", and "Glory". JoJo's new website under Atlantic Records
